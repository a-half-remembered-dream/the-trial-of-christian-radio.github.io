          Christian radio has been slandered. The world's most credible news agency, the <a href="https://babylonbee.com
          /news/close-call-this-christian-radio-dj-accidentally-played-the-same-song-for-3-weeks-straight-but-luckily-no
          -one-noticed">Babylon Bee</a>, has charged Christian radio with playing bland, repetitive music. This is a
          serious accusation, and it deserves our attention - just enough to read this webpage. Accusations can be
          thrown around all day, but none will be meaningful without hard evidence. To test the sentence weighed against
          Christian radio, we need to find a way to gather some evidence.

          We need to know what songs are played on the stations, when they are played, and how often they are played.
          The 20th century way to do this would be to tune into the radio every few minutes to record what song is
          currently playing. There's nothing wrong with doing this, except for the fact that it will eat up a large
          chunk of the little time you have left in life, time that is every-so-slowly slipping through your fingers.
          Given this frustrating reality, we are going to try it the modern way. The 21st century way is to turn to the
          time-saving wonders of automation.

          Automating a computer-related task can be as simple as writing a small script. I have chosen the scripting
          language Python for its simplicity.

          Before we starting writing code, we need to ask the question: *what is a website made of anyway?* Mostly bits
          and pieces. The foundation of any website is HTML, which is what we want for this project. HTML also includes
          links to other types of information, like CSS code to make the HTML pretty, Javascript to make the browser do
          tasks and make the HTML change, and embedded content like ads and YouTube videos that load content from other
          servers.

          Most importantly, HTML describes how all the text on a website is structured. This is important because this
          is the Air1 website that we need to take data from:

        </p>
        <img class="fit mb-5 ml-lg-2" src="imgs/air1_recently_played.png" alt="Air1 recently played songs">
        <p>

          To distinguish between songs, we really just need the song title, but it is also useful to have the album name
          and the artist name, in case we want to stats on albums or artists.

        <p>
          Here is a graph of the times where the song "Symphony" by the artist "Switch" was played on Air1.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <img class="fit ml-4 mb-5" src="graphs/symphony_play_times2.png" alt="Figure 1">
        <p class="text-justify">

          As you can see, Air1 *loves* to play this song - to my pain. This graph confirms my theory that Air1 plays
          this song way too much. It's not that I have chosen unlucky times to tune in, but that Air1 has a problem.
          (It's not me, it's you, Air1!)

          <br><br>
          (There are a few points on the graph where the song is "played" almost back-to-back. These are errors in my
          song-stitching algorithm. Sometimes when the script checks the Air1 recently-added page, it adds a duplicate
          song. However, these errors are easy to spot.)

          <br><br>
          This pattern would be understandable if this song was recently released, but Air1 started playing this song
          *at least two weeks* before I started collecting this data. Only recently has the station started playing it
          this much. When the song was first played, it was my favorite on Air1, but it was not actually played very
          frequently, even though it deserved to be played more. Air1 mostly ignored the song for the first two weeks.
          When Air1 actually picked up that people enjoyed the song, the station started playing it on repeat, as the
          graph shows. The problem is that they delayed the "launch" of the song - the boost in play frequency - by at
          least two weeks. This made listeners who liked the song at the beginning become frustrated that the song was
          not played enough, and listeners at the end become frustrated that the song was being played *too much*. They
          missed the best opportunity to play the song the most, which was at the *very beginning*. They should have
          realized the song was going to be popular, sooner.

          <br><br>
          The song "Symphony" is a good example of a top 10 song on Air1. As they should, Air1 wants to play the most
          popular songs the most ... but how often are we talking about? Well, it turns out that the top 10 songs
          constitute **26.6% of all songs played** on the station at any given time! This means that if you listen to
          Air1 for 30 minutes, you will listen to an average of 7.6 songs during that time, so that means that the
          probability that you will not hear one song from the top 10 is **11.3%**. I hope you're not sick of any of
          those songs!

          <br><br>
          Air1 has obviously put a priority on playing the newest, most popular songs and has neglected to play
          lesser-known songs. Interesting business choice. There's nothing wrong with that, except for that Air1's most
          regular listeners have got to be bored out of their minds or have just given up on caring. Now, I'm not a
          businessman, but I do know that's is not a great idea for a business to prioritize its least loyal customers
          at the expense of its most loyal customers. This is what Air1 is doing by playing their top songs this often.

          <br><br>
          Now, when I saw these results I admit that I thought the verdict was made. After all, this is egregious
          repetition! But sometimes it is best to step back and look at the big picture, and this is what you see:
        </p>
        <img class="fit mb-sm-5 mb-lg-0 ml-lg-2" src="graphs/frequency_comparison_final.png">
        <p class="text-justify mb-5">
          These are what I call the "frequency curves" of each station. These graphs show us the big picture of how
          often a song of a certain popularity is played on the station.

          <br><br>
          The X axis represents each distinct song played on the station sorted from most popular to least popular. So
          when x is 1, y is the percentage of times the most popular song was played on the station (out of all the
          songs played). As it should be, there is a negative correlation between the popularity ranking of a song (the
          x axis) and the times it is played (the y axis).
        </p>
        <img class="fit mb-sm-5 mb-lg-0 ml-lg-5" src="imgs/dust_devil_small.jpg" alt="A dust devil">
        <!--        <img class="fit mb-sm-5 mb-lg-0 ml-lg-5 pt-3" src="imgs/city_sizes_small.jpg" alt="Text" style="float: right;">-->
        <p class="text-justify mb-3">
          But the slope of these curves are just ridiculous! This is a type of **power-law distribution**, a pattern
          that arises when a small minority of subjects hold the majority of a certain quantity. This pattern is seen
          everywhere in our world and it pops us in the most random places. Here are a few examples of phenomena that
          follow the power-law pattern: the distribution of wealth, the distribution of the mass of stars in the
          universe, the size of cities, the frequency of words in text, the magnitude of wars and terrorist attacks, and
          even the diameters of dust devils! Most of the experiences in life we consider "random" are really just the
          result of complex interactions that actually form regular patterns. Our brains are usually just too distracted
          by the present moment to notice the bigger picture.

          <br><br>
          Back to the song frequency distribution. These stations aren't wrong to use a power-law distribution; the
          problem is the **bend** in the curve.
        </p>
        <img class="fit mb-sm-5 mb-lg-0 ml-lg-5" src="graphs/frequency_comparison_final_markup.png"
             alt="Frequency comparison graph with tails labeled">
        <p class="text-justify mb-3">
          You can also infer the size of the song collection of each station from how long the "tails" of each line
          extend. I collected data from KISS's website for about a third of the time as Air1 and KLOVE, so if I wanted
          to quantitatively compare the size of each station's music collection, I should collect data on KISS for a
          little longer. All I really care about, however, is a qualititive comparison of which station plays *more*
          songs, and it looks settled that the song collection of KISS is at least the same as or smaller than Air1's
          collection.

          <br><br>
          These results are surprising! Christian radio might deserve some due criticism about its boring repetition,
          but if we are being fair, secular stations like KISS deserve that same complaint too.
