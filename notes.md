# The Slander

- Christian radio is bland and uncreative
- This story will be a fair judgment

Christian radio has been slandered. The world's most credible news agency, the Babylon Bee (https://babylonbee.com/news/close-call-this-christian-radio-dj-accidentally-played-the-same-song-for-3-weeks-straight-but-luckily-no-one-noticed), has charged Christian radio with playing bland, repetitive music. This is a serious accusation, and it deserves our attention - just enough to read this webpage.

Accusations can be thrown around all day, but none will be meaningful without hard evidence. To test the sentence weighed against Christian radio, we need to find a way to gather some evidence. We need a script.

# The Script

We need to know what songs are played on the stations, when they are played, and how often they are played. The 20th century way to do this would be to tune into the radio every few minutes to record what song is currently playing. There's nothing wrong with doing this, except for the fact that it will eat up a large chunk of the little time you have left in life, time that is every-so-slowly slipping through your fingers. Given this frustrating reality, you may want to try it the modern way. The 21st century way of doing this is to turn to the time-saving wonders of automation.

Despite popular belief, you do not have to surrender your soul to a machine to program a computer. Automating a computer-related task can be as simple as writing a small script. I have chosen the scripting language Python for its simplicity.

# The Stats

- frequency graph
- 10 top song frequency stat
- TODO - comparison with KISS

Here is a graph of the times where the song "Symphony" by the artist "Switch" was played on Air1. 

As you can see, Air1 *loves* to play this song, to my pain. This graph confirms my theory that Air1 plays this song way too much. It's not that I'm choosing the wrong times to listen to the station (or that I'm plain crazy), but that Air1 has a problem.

There are a few points on the graph where the song is "played" almost back-to-back. These are errors in my song-stitching algorithm. Sometimes when the script checks the Air1 recently-added page, it adds a duplicate song. However, these errors are easy to spot.

# The Sentence
